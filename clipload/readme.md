# clipload

Script to quickly generate a random text payload of any given length, suitable for DDoS testing. The payload is placed directly into the clipboard, so it only needs to be pasted into the target after running the script.

## Usage

```python
python3 clipload.py -l 1000000
```

Note: If you generate big chunks make sure your memory can handle it (ãƒ„)


## Install

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
